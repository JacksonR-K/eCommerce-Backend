## Installation

Install MySQL to host the database: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/. While in MySQL, run the 'schema.sql' file. Once your database is setup, in your terminal, navigate to the root folder and run 'npm i' to install the dependencies. Optionally, from the root folder, run node ./seeds to add data to your database or add your own manually. 

## Usage

To start the database connection, run either 'node server.js' or 'npm start' from the root folder. Using the various GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes, you can now modify values in your database.
